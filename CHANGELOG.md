## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Tempo Map editor** — an EOF-style mode for fitting the song-wide beat
  grid to the audio. A new **🎵 Tempo Map** toolbar button (works on both
  sloppak and PSARC) swaps the canvas to a tempo view: the waveform plus a
  draggable vertical "sync-point" pole at every measure downbeat, with each
  measure's BPM and time signature derived from sync-point spacing.
  - **Drag** a sync point to retime — only the two adjacent measures
    recompute their BPM; every other measure stays put.
  - **Insert / delete** sync points (right-click menu, or the Insert /
    Delete keys) to split or merge measures.
  - **Time signature** — `[` / `]` (or the right-click menu) change the
    selected measure's beats-per-measure; the interior grid re-subdivides.
  - **Notes ride the grid** with a user-selectable scope: a "Apply tempo
    edits to" toggle chooses **Drum tab only** (default — never disturbs a
    guitar/bass/keys chart) or **All instruments** (full retempo). The
    choice persists in `localStorage`.
  - A dimmed reference layer shows the current arrangement's notes and the
    drum-tab hits at their absolute times, so the grid can be aligned to
    them and the waveform.
  - Every edit is a single undo step (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y).
